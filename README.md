# Fastpassword

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ZIJ/fastpassword.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ZIJ/fastpassword)

Command-line utility that generates fast-to-type passwords.

### Why
1. Most (if not all) existing password generators are focused on security or readability, but not ease of typing
2. I wanted to get hands dirty with ES 2015 features

### How to use
Coming soon...
